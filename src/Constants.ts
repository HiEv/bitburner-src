v2.3.0 Hotfixes (last updated 30 May 2023)
------------------------------------------

* Several important fixes for savegame migration issues from older version (@d0sboots)
* Prevent scripts from loading during intial migration to 2.3.0 save format, to prevent a crash that could occur. (@Snarling)
* Fix scp logging (hostname was being logged incorrectly in multiple places and showing as [Object object]) (@Snarling)
* Update alias help text to show new working syntax (outdated fix) (@Snarling)
* Update terminal parsing logic so that the old syntax for alias works again. (@Snarling)
* Fix clickable script links from ls command not working outside root directory (@Snarling)
* Fix SF3 "Spring Water" industry (@Snarling)
* Fix an issue with Find All Valid Math Expressions not accepting empty array when that was the solution. (@Snarling)
* Fix an issue with scan-analyze display when the player had AutoLink.exe (@Snarling)
* Reverted undocumented change that program filenames were case sensitive for ns.fileExists. They are case insensitive again. (@Snarling)
* Fix issue that could lead to SF3 research desync. (@Snarling)
* An issue from pre-2.3 could cause scripts to have the wrong "server" property. This caused issues in 2.3, and a fix now repairs any scripts with a mismatched server property. (@Snarling)

v2.3.0 - SF3 rework and performance improvements (25 May 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BREAKING CHANGES: These changes may require changes to your scripts.

* Major changes to the SF3 mechanic. See the related section below for more detailed info on the changes.
* The same script filename can now be ran multiple times with the same args. If running a script from another script (ns.run/ns.exec/etc), this limitation can be re-imposed with the preventDuplicates RunOption (see general section for info on RunOptions).
* The same .js script will now be the same js module whether the script was ran directly or used as an import. This means top-level variables (variables defined outside of any function) are shared across all instances of the script.
* The js module for a script will also be reused by any script that has the exact same compiled text, even if that script is on another server or has a different filename. This can lead to unexpected results when using top-level variables.
* Some properties removed from ns.getPlayer and added to a separate function ns.getResetInfo. These are still accessible from getPlayer but will produce a warning message the first time they are accessed per game session.
* hackAnalyzeThreads now returns -1, instead of 0, when no money can be hacked from the targeted server.
* ns.iKnowWhatImDoing has been removed, replaced by ns.tprintRaw for printing custom react content to the terminal (limited support).

PERFORMANCE:

* Minimize impact of unavoidable memory leak when modules are created, by reusing modules as much as possible (@d0sboots)
* Internal data structure changes (@d0sboots, @Snarling)
* Fix memory leak when initializing large number of netscript ports (@Snarling)
* Improve performance while on the Active Scripts page if many scripts are starting/ending. (@d0sboots)

NETSCRIPT GENERAL:

* Remove requirement for script args to be unique. This was also related to performance improvements. (@d0sboots)
* ns.hackAnalyzeThreads no longer indicates infinity any time a single thread would hack less than $1 (@Snarling)
* ns.renamePurchasedServer no longer crashes if player is connected to the server being renamed (@Snarling)
* ns.hackAnalyzeThreads now return -1 (instead of 0) if no money can be hacked from the targeted server. (@d0sboots)
* Fix a possible infinite atExit loop if a script killed itself. (@Snarling)
* Static timestamps of last resets can be obtained via ns.getResetInfo, replacing playtimeSinceLastX from ns.getPlayer (@G4mingJon4s)
* Improved support for printing react content directly to the terminal (ns.tprintRaw) or to a script log (ns.printRaw).
* Added RunOptions, which can optionally replace the "threads" argument for ns.run/ns.exec/ns.spawn. (@d0sboots)
  * RunOptions.threads: Provide a thread count (since RunOptions can replace the threads argument)
  * RunOptions.temporary: Prevents the script execution from being included in the save file.
  * RunOptions.ramOverride: Provide a static ram cost for the script to override what is calculated by the game. Dynamic ram checking is still enforced.
  * RunOptions.preventDuplicates: Fail to launch the script if the args are identical to a script already running.

GENERAL / MISC:

* Fixed a bug that could cause the overview skill bars to become desynced (@d0sboots)
* There is now an autoexec setting to specify a script on home to automatically run when loading the game. (@d0sboots)
* Monaco script editor updated to a newer version and has more config options available now. (@Snarling)
* Improve Electron's handling of external links (@Snarling) 
* Improved support for ANSI color codes (@d0sboots)
* Improved consistency of file paths. Correct names for files no longer start with a / even if they are in a directory. (@Snarling)
* All Math Expressions contract no longer accepts wrong answers (@Snarling)
* Faction invites now trigger immediately when backdooring a server. (@Snarling)
* Fixed issue where duplicate programs could be created. (@Minzenkatze)
* UI improvements to create program page (@Minzenkatze)
* Fix inconsistency in skill xp to skill level conversion (@hydroflame)
* Updated blood donation counter to reflect number of confirmed blood donations. (@hydroflame)
* Minor improvements to ram calculation process (@Snarling)
* Improved terminal arguments detection (@Snarling)
* Improved display for ls terminal command. (@Snarling)
* Added more internal tests and improved test quality (@d0sboots)
* Various codebase improvements (@Snarling, @d0sboots)
* Documentation improvements (Many contributors)
* Nerf noodle bar
